FBS Assignment Repository
This repository contains all the code and files for my assignments and class tests.
It serves as a centralized location for submitting and organizing Java programs developed during the course.

/assignments: Contains all the assignment-related code files.
Each assignment is organized in separate folders (e.g., assignment1, assignment2, etc.).
Each folder includes the source code and any additional resources or documentation specific to the assignment.


/tests: Contains code files for class tests.
Each test is organized in separate folders (e.g., test1, test2, etc.).
