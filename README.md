Core Java Assignment Repository
Overview
This repository contains all the code and files for my Core Java class assignments and class tests. It serves as a centralized location for submitting and organizing Java programs developed during the course.
Repository Structure

/assignments: Contains all the assignment-related Java code files.
Each assignment is organized in separate folders (e.g., assignment1, assignment2, etc.).
Each folder includes the Java source code (.java files) and any additional resources or documentation specific to the assignment.
